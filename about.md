I'm a software developer based in Melbourne Australia working for [PageUp People](http://pageuppeople.com).

My first experience with code was in primary school playing with a turtle on an Apple IIe.

Though now I'm a skilled .NET software developer, I'm curious and love checking out new things.

More recently I've been developing apps for Windows Phone and Windows 8 in my spare time.
